## 5. Energy Harvesting System

The energy harvesting system captures energy from three primary sources:

2. **Current Sensing**: Captures energy from the current flowing through the solenoid
3. **Magnetic Field Fluctuations**: Harvests energy from the oscillating magnetic field

Based on simulation results, the system can harvest approximately [X] mWh per irrigation cycle, which is sufficient to maintain operation with [Y] irrigation cycles per day.

## 6. Precision Control Mechanism

The device achieves precise control of the solenoid valve through:
1. **PWM Modulation**: Varies the duty cycle to control the average current through the solenoid
2. **Current Feedback**: Monitors the actual current to ensure accurate positioning
3. **Adaptive Algorithm**: Adjusts control parameters based on valve behavior and environmental conditions

This approach enables the valve to be positioned at any point between fully closed and fully open, allowing for precise flow control that is not possible with traditional on/off solenoid operation.
