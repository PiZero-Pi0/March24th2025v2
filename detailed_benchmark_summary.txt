Here is the extracted information from the text, organized into sections with appropriate headings:

## Energy Cube Specifications
### Theoretical Maximum Energy Output (E_max)
$$$ E_{max} = \frac{\kappa \cdot Q}{t} = \frac{0.85 \cdot 5000}{3600} = 1.18 \text{ W} $$$

### Energy Density (D_E)
$$$ D_{E} = \frac{E_{max}}{V} = \frac{1.18}{125} = 0.0094 \text{ W/cm}^3 $$$

## Pi-Battery Specifications
### Maximum Current Delivery (I_max)
$$$ I_{max} = \frac{P}{V_{pi}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5.00 \text{ A} $$$

### Operational Time Estimate (T_op)
$$$ T_{op} = \frac{C}{I_{max}} = \frac{10000/1000}{5.00} = 2.00 \text{ hours} $$$
